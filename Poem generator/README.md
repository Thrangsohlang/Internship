# poem Generator

In this practice project, I use the ability of langchain models to make a poem generator and deploy it using streamlit.
The main feature of this poem generator is that it can generate a poem using the provided input and write a poem in the style of "John Keats".
I use two models for generating the text: "gpt-3.5-turbo" and "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"
